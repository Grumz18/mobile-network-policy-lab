# PROJECT_STATE

## PROJECT_ID
adaptive-mobile-network-lab

## CURRENT_PHASE
Repository bootstrap, governance anchoring, repository execution-surface bootstrap, server baseline definition, Android fork baseline definition, Android local build baseline definition, Android fork intake and patch workflow baseline, upstream fork snapshot materialization, and initial Android build verification are complete through CP-008.
The repository is operating under a checkpoint-driven workflow with documented local, server, and Android bootstrap guidance.
The next eligible work is to define CP-009 from the documented CP-008 blockers.

## CONFIRMED_FOUNDATIONS
The repository exists and is pushed.
The following bootstrap files are assumed to exist and remain authoritative:
- docs/bootstrap/01_LLM_OPERATING_CONTRACT.md
- docs/bootstrap/02_LLM_CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL.md
- docs/bootstrap/03_OWNER_PROJECT_MAP.md

## CURRENT_OBJECTIVE
Preserve all baselines created through CP-008.
Use the CP-008 verification report to define the next bounded checkpoint for prerequisite bootstrap and external dependency materialization.
No server or Android implementation should begin outside an approved checkpoint.

## WHAT_EXISTS_NOW

- Materialized upstream NekoBox snapshot in android/fork/ (commit 5768494d8ae3c74a057bb6d46c0f8dc071b0d821)
- Upstream tracking metadata file
- Initial Android build verification report

## WHAT_DOES_NOT_EXIST_YET
- Android build-ready local workstation/toolchain state
- Materialized external local source dependencies required by `libcore` (`libneko`, `sing-box`)
- Local patches against fork content (requires a post-build-verification checkpoint)

## EXECUTION_RULE
From this point forward, all work must begin from a checkpoint file.
Each checkpoint must be small, bounded, and end with an updated handoff section.

## NEXT_REQUIRED_ACTION
Define CP-009 to bootstrap the missing Android build prerequisites and external source dependencies identified by CP-008.

## RISK_NOTES
The main risk at this stage is scope drift from verification into unbounded repair or implementation.
If future work starts Android product implementation, per-app routing, transport logic, or ad hoc toolchain repair before CP-009 is defined, continuity and checkpoint discipline will degrade.

## OWNER_DECISION_LOG
- The project is personal, research-oriented, and not aimed at app store deployment first.
- Android-first path is accepted.
- NekoBox fork direction is accepted.
- NaiveProxy-centered transport direction is accepted.
- Per-app routing on Android is a mandatory product capability.
