# PROJECT_STATE

## PROJECT_ID
adaptive-mobile-network-lab

## CURRENT_PHASE
Repository bootstrap, governance anchoring, repository execution-surface bootstrap, server baseline definition, Android fork baseline definition, Android local build baseline definition, and Android fork intake and patch workflow baseline are complete through CP-006.
The repository is operating under a checkpoint-driven workflow with documented local, server, and Android bootstrap guidance.
The next eligible work is to define CP-007.

## CONFIRMED_FOUNDATIONS
The repository exists and is pushed.
The following bootstrap files are assumed to exist and remain authoritative:
- docs/bootstrap/01_LLM_OPERATING_CONTRACT.md
- docs/bootstrap/02_LLM_CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL.md
- docs/bootstrap/03_OWNER_PROJECT_MAP.md

## CURRENT_OBJECTIVE
Preserve all baselines created through CP-006.
Prepare the next bounded checkpoint for executing the fork intake (materializing upstream NekoBox code).
No server or Android implementation should begin outside an approved checkpoint.

## WHAT_EXISTS_NOW
- Git repository initialized
- Base folder structure created
- Bootstrap LLM guidance files added
- Initial commit pushed
- Global project state file established
- First checkpoint file finalized
- Second checkpoint executed and finalized
- Third checkpoint executed and finalized
- Fourth checkpoint executed and finalized
- Fifth checkpoint executed and finalized
- Sixth checkpoint executed and finalized
- README aligned to the checkpoint workflow
- Repository execution surface document
- Development environment bootstrap document
- Root editor and ignore baseline files
- Root example environment file
- Local bootstrap helper script
- Server baseline document
- Server workspace baseline files
- Server baseline verification script
- Android fork baseline document
- Android workspace baseline files
- Android baseline verification script
- Android local build baseline document
- Android local build placeholder files
- Android local build verification script
- Android fork intake document
- Android patch workflow document
- Android fork intake verification script

## WHAT_DOES_NOT_EXIST_YET
- Materialized upstream fork code in android/fork/ (requires CP-007)
- Local patches against fork content (requires post-intake checkpoint)

## EXECUTION_RULE
From this point forward, all work must begin from a checkpoint file.
Each checkpoint must be small, bounded, and end with an updated handoff section.

## NEXT_REQUIRED_ACTION
Define CP-007 for executing the fork intake (materialize upstream NekoBox code into android/fork/).

## RISK_NOTES
The main risk at this stage is scope drift from governance into implementation.
If future work starts Android product implementation, per-app routing, or transport logic before CP-006 is defined, continuity and checkpoint discipline will degrade.

## OWNER_DECISION_LOG
- The project is personal, research-oriented, and not aimed at app store deployment first.
- Android-first path is accepted.
- NekoBox fork direction is accepted.
- NaiveProxy-centered transport direction is accepted.
- Per-app routing on Android is a mandatory product capability.
