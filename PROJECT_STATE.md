# PROJECT_STATE

## PROJECT_ID
adaptive-mobile-network-lab

## CURRENT_PHASE
Repository bootstrap, governance anchoring, repository execution-surface bootstrap, server baseline definition, Android fork baseline definition, Android local build baseline definition, Android fork intake and patch workflow baseline, upstream fork snapshot materialization, initial Android build verification, Android build-prerequisite bootstrap, the first Android build attempt, libcore gomobile blocker diagnosis, and the bounded CP-012 repair-checkpoint definition are complete through CP-012 definition.
The repository is operating under a checkpoint-driven workflow with documented local, server, and Android bootstrap guidance.
The next eligible work is to execute CP-012 from the documented CP-011 blocker diagnosis and the authored CP-012 repair boundary.

## CONFIRMED_FOUNDATIONS
The repository exists and is pushed.
The following bootstrap files are assumed to exist and remain authoritative:
- docs/bootstrap/01_LLM_OPERATING_CONTRACT.md
- docs/bootstrap/02_LLM_CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL.md
- docs/bootstrap/03_OWNER_PROJECT_MAP.md

## CURRENT_OBJECTIVE
Preserve all baselines created through CP-011 and the authored CP-012 repair boundary.
The libcore gomobile/go.mod blocker is now localized to zero-byte generated `go.mod` files under `.build/src-android-*`.
The next step is to execute the smallest bounded repair checkpoint defined in CP-012 before retrying the native build path.
No server or Android implementation should begin outside an approved checkpoint.

- Cached Gradle 8.10.2 wrapper distribution

## WHAT_DOES_NOT_EXIST_YET
- Successful Android build output (`libcore.aar`, APK)
- Local patches against fork content (requires a post-build-verification checkpoint)

## EXECUTION_RULE
From this point forward, all work must begin from a checkpoint file.
Each checkpoint must be small, bounded, and end with an updated handoff section.

## NEXT_REQUIRED_ACTION
Execute CP-012 to attempt the smallest evidence-backed, tool-local repair for the zero-byte generated `go.mod` files in the libcore gomobile path and record the outcome in `docs/android/ANDROID_LIBCORE_GOMOBILE_REPAIR_ATTEMPT.md`.

## RISK_NOTES
The main risk at this stage is scope drift from bounded blocker repair into unbounded build experimentation or implementation.
The current blocker is localized to generated temporary module state in the gomobile/native bridge path, but the exact repair may still need to distinguish between gomobile behavior and upstream layout assumptions.
CP-012 intentionally limits the first repair attempt to the local `gomobile-matsuri` generated-module write path and must not drift into upstream Android source edits or broader build continuation.
The `libneko` and `sing-box` source trees are cloned at default branch HEAD, not pinned to a revision matching the upstream fork snapshot. Additional module-alignment issues may appear after the current blocker is resolved.
`JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` are not persisted to the system environment and must be set per-session.
If future work starts Android product implementation, per-app routing, transport logic, or broad build repair before CP-012 is executed and closed, continuity and checkpoint discipline will degrade.

## OWNER_DECISION_LOG
- The project is personal, research-oriented, and not aimed at app store deployment first.
- Android-first path is accepted.
- NekoBox fork direction is accepted.
- NaiveProxy-centered transport direction is accepted.
- Per-app routing on Android is a mandatory product capability.
